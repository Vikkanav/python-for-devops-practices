# For Loop DevOps use-cases

1. **Server Provisioning and Configuration:**

   DevOps engineers use "for" loops when provisioning multiple servers or virtual machines with the same configuration. For example, when setting up monitoring agents on multiple servers:

   ```bash
   servers=("server1" "server2" "server3")
   for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
       configure_monitoring_agent "$server"
   done
   ```

2. **Deploying Configurations to Multiple Environments:**

   When deploying configurations to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production), DevOps engineers can use a "for" loop to apply the same configuration changes to each environment:

   ```bash
   environments=("dev" "staging" "prod")
   for env in "${environments[@]}"; do
       deploy_configuration "$env"
   done
   ```

3. **Backup and Restore Operations:**

   Automating backup and restore operations is a common use case. DevOps engineers can use "for" loops to create backups for multiple databases or services and later restore them as needed.

   ```bash
   databases=("db1" "db2" "db3")
   for db in "${databases[@]}"; do
       create_backup "$db"
   done
   ```

4. **Log Rotation and Cleanup:**

   DevOps engineers use "for" loops to manage log files, rotate logs, and clean up older log files to save disk space.

   ```bash
   log_files=("app.log" "access.log" "error.log")
   for log_file in "${log_files[@]}"; do
       rotate_and_cleanup_logs "$log_file"
   done
   ```

5. **Monitoring and Reporting:**

   In scenarios where you need to gather data or perform checks on multiple systems, a "for" loop is handy. For example, monitoring server resources across multiple machines:

   ```bash
   servers=("server1" "server2" "server3")
   for server in "${servers[@]}"; do
       check_resource_utilization "$server"
   done
   ```

6. **Managing Cloud Resources:**

   When working with cloud infrastructure, DevOps engineers can use "for" loops to manage resources like virtual machines, databases, and storage across different cloud providers.

   ```bash
   instances=("instance1" "instance2" "instance3")
   for instance in "${instances[@]}"; do
       resize_instance "$instance"
   done
   ```
