# Bitwise Operations in Python

## Introduction

Bitwise operators in Python are used to perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers. These operators include bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and more.

## List of Bitwise Operators

1. **Bitwise AND (&):** Performs a bitwise AND operation on the binary representations of the operands.
2. **Bitwise OR (|):** Performs a bitwise OR operation.
3. **Bitwise XOR (^):** Performs a bitwise XOR operation.
4. **Bitwise NOT (~):** Flips the bits of the operand, changing 0 to 1 and 1 to 0.
5. **Left Shift (<<):** Shifts the bits to the left by a specified number of positions.
6. **Right Shift (>>):** Shifts the bits to the right.

## Examples

### Bitwise AND

```python
a = 5  # Binary: 0101
b = 3  # Binary: 0011
result = a & b  # Result: 0001 (Decimal: 1)
```

### Bitwise OR

```python
x = 10  # Binary: 1010
y = 7   # Binary: 0111
result = x | y  # Result: 1111 (Decimal: 15)
```
