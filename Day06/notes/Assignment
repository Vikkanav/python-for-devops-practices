# Assignment Operations in Python

## Introduction

Assignment operators in Python are used to assign values to variables. They include the basic assignment operator (=) and various compound assignment operators that perform an operation on the variable while assigning a value.

## List of Assignment Operators

1. **Basic Assignment (=):** Assigns a value to a variable.

2. **Addition Assignment (+=):** Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

3. **Subtraction Assignment (-=):** Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

4. **Multiplication Assignment (*=):** Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

5. **Division Assignment (/=):** Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

6. **Floor Division Assignment (//=):** Performs floor division on the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

7. **Modulus Assignment (%=):** Calculates the modulus of the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

8. **Exponentiation Assignment (**=):** Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

## Examples

### Basic Assignment

```python
x = 5
```

### Addition Assignment

```python
y = 10
y += 3  # Equivalent to y = y + 3
```
