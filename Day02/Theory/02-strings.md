# Strings

**1. String Data Type in Python:**

- In Python, a string is a sequence of characters, enclosed within single (' '), double (" "), or triple (''' ''' or """ """) quotes.
- Strings are immutable, meaning you cannot change the characters within a string directly. Instead, you create new strings.
- You can access individual characters in a string using indexing, e.g., `my_string[0]` will give you the first character.
- Strings support various built-in methods, such as `len()`, `upper()`, `lower()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, and more, for manipulation.

**2. String Manipulation and Formatting:**

- Concatenation: You can combine strings using the `+` operator.
- Substrings: Use slicing to extract portions of a string, e.g., `my_string[2:5]` will extract characters from the 2nd to the 4th position.
- String interpolation: Python supports various ways to format strings, including f-strings (f"...{variable}..."), %-formatting ("%s %d" % ("string", 42)), and `str.format()`.
- Escape sequences: Special characters like newline (\n), tab (\t), and others are represented using escape sequences.
- String methods: Python provides many built-in methods for string manipulation, such as `split()`, `join()`, and `startswith()`.
